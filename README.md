# Production-line
Factory Simulation using FACTORY I/O for 3D visuals and Siemens TIA Portal with Ladder Logic for control.

## ðŸš€ Key Features of Our Production Line:
â€¢ Feeding and Sorting: Vision sensors and pick & place robots sort raw materials by color.
â€¢ Machining Station: Robotic arms and CNC machines transform raw materials into lids and bases with precision.
â€¢ Jamming Prevention: Automated blocking mechanisms regulate part flow to avoid overlaps.
â€¢ Assembly Unit: Components are clamped and assembled into complete products with error-free alignment.
â€¢ HMI Design: Real-time control panel including counters, warning messages, and interactive start/stop/reset functionality.

## Once the target number of assembled products was reached, the system automatically shut down, ensuring efficiency and control from start to finish.
